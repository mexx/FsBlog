I solve problems.

Working with a **heads-up** attitude, I also understand that *the best fix isn&#39;t always writing code*. Sometimes the correct answer lies in finding issue with a procedure or policy and championing a change that makes a code change unnecessary.

My credentials include work with many technologies and programming languages, and I am very capable at writing code to tackle issues along the way, having worked with .NET, Java, Python, and many others.

I have a voracious appetite for learning and will quickly acquire the domain knowledge in your company to be able to coordinate solutions across group boundaries.

If you&#39;re looking for an employee that can write a lot of high-quality code, I can do that very well. If you&#39;re looking for an employee that can really apply himself to see the big picture and *help direct future growth*, I can do that even better.

I am well adapted to working in high-pressure situations and delivering. The ideal job would include me working with large-scale, performance-critical systems, especially dealing with information security.
